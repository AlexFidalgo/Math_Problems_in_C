Given a sequence of number inputted by the user, check if each one is the sum of four squares of consecutive prime numbers. For example, for 87 it is true:

87 = 22^2 + 32^2 + 52^2 + 72^2

Also for 1002172:

1002172 = 491^2 + 499^2 + 503^2 + 509^2

But not for 88 or 100.

In addition, calcute the Tetranacci Number of n. The Tetranacci series represent the n=4 case of the Fibonacci n-step numbers and is given by:

T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + T(n-3) + T(n-4) with T(0)=0, T(1)=1, T(2)=1, T(3)=2.
